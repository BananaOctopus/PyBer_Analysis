# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this final analysis was to have a clear graph to show the total fares spent by customers of PyBer by types of areas in the first quarter of 2019. This graph shows valuable customer spending habits that will be useful to PyBer in deciding in which area they spend more time recruting drivers for.

## Results:
**All Figures are in the Resource folder**
The different city types definitly have major differences. Rural cities have less drivers(Fig 3) and less total rides(Fig 5) than suburban and urban areas which makes the average fare per ride(Fig 2) more expensive. As the population of the cities increases from suburban to urban cities, there are more drivers and more total rides, but in turn that makes the average fare ride for the customer cheaper. With the higher amount of total rides, the total fare(Fig 4) of the urban cities still account for over half of the total fares earned by PyBer, see graph below:

## Summary:

Rural cities have less drivers and less total rides which makes the average fare per ride more expensive, so there are people willing to take a ride with PyBer. My recommendation would be to recruite more drivers for rural cities since there is a market there. Since the average fare for urban areas is somewhat low, it may be wise to either keep the same amount of drivers or transfer some drivers to the suburban or rural areas just to make sure the prices stay the same/dont decrease.
