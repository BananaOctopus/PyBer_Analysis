# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this final analysis was to have a clear graph to show the total fares spent by customers of Pyber by types of areas in the first quarter of 2019. This graph shows valuable customer spending habits that will be useful to PyBer in deciding in which area they spend more time recruting drivers for.

## Results:

The different city types definitly have major differences. Rural cities have less drivers and less total rides which makes the average fare per ride more expensive. As the population of the cities increases from suburban to urban cities, there are more drivers and more total rides, but in turn that makes the average fare ride for the customer cheaper. With the higher amount of total rides, the total fare of the urban cities still account for over half of the total fares earned by PyBer.

## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
